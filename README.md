## Discussion

  While making this code, I encountered a problem where the index.html file wasn't
  opening on my browser, and I had to copy path in order to access it. After dealing with that though, everything else was pretty simple. I looked up interesting holidays, I made a card, and that was all. There weren't any other errors or challenges, and it was pretty easy. 

## Testing

I made sure that everything worked, and it all looked good.
